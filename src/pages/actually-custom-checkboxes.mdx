title: Create an actually custom checkbox
---

import CodeSandbox from "./../components/CodeSandbox.astro";

You have Googled to the ends of the Earth to figure out how to actually customize a checkbox.

# Is this guide for me?

- Have you ever written an SVG is _AND/OR_ do you have the assets you need for your checkboxes in hand?
- Are you absolutely sure you don't want to use the native checkbox?
- Like, really sure?
- Because there's a lot good about using the platform.
- Would you be happier using an off-the-shelf checkbox from a component library?
- Are you willing to write a version of your checkbox for every state (focused, hovered, etc)?
- Are you already using React? Because we're going to use it here. Though you absolutetly do not need to.

# Let's see it working first.

# CSS Variables

Let's take a look at `styles.css`. If you're unfamiliar with CSS variables this might feel a little strange.

```css
input[type="checkbox"] {
  width: 1rem;
  height: 1rem;
  appearance: var(--appearance);
  -webkit-appearance: var(--appearance);
}

input[type="checkbox"]::before {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  content: "";
  display: block;
  background-size: contain;
  background-image: var(--svgStringInitial);
}

input[type="checkbox"]:checked::before {
  background-image: var(--svgStringChecked);
}

input[type="checkbox"]:disabled::before {
  background-image: var(--svgStringDisabled);
}
```

On line 4 we see

```css
appearance: var(--appearance);
```

This `var()` lets us access a value we've declared elsewhere. In this case we've declared it inline in the JSX.

```jsx
export default function Checkbox() {
  const cssVariables = {
    "--apperance": "none",
    "--svgStringInitial": svgString("black"),
    "--svgStringChecked": svgString("green"),
    "--svgStringDisabled": svgString("gray"),
  };
  return <input style={cssVariables} type="checkbox" />;
}
```

These variables are just the same as any other CSS property.

You probably notice however though that we're setting `--appearance` here. This is a nice fallback measure in the case that the browser does not support CSS variables [(actually rather unlikelyâ€”but best to fallback to the system checkbox if so)](https://caniuse.com/css-variables).

# Data URLs

You're probably familiar with a base64 data url. But since our SVGs are made up of UTF-8 characters rather than a buffer, we can skip that extra encoding.

_HOWEVER_ we do need to encode the string somehow because there's a mix of dashes, parens, colons, all over the string.

Fortunately the browser gives us what we need here, [`encodeURIComponent()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/encodeURIComponent). The one gotcha that remains is that both single and double quotes are URI safe characters. They're control characters in CSS though so we have to encode them ourselves.

```js
const svgToDataUrl = (svg) => {
  return (
    "data:image/svg+xml," +
    encodeURIComponent(svg).replace(/'/g, "%27").replace(/"/g, "%22")
  );
};
```
